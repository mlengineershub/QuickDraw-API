# QuickDraw API

Welcome to the QuickDraw API repository. This project encompasses the development of a machine learning model and its deployment through a user-friendly application. The complete project details are available [here](https://github.com/mlengineershub/QuickDraw-ML).

## Project Workflow

1. **Machine Learning Model Development**
    - The initial phase involved developing the machine learning model. Detailed information about the model can be found [here](https://github.com/mlengineershub/QuickDraw-ML).

2. **API Endpoint Deployment**
    - We deployed the API endpoints using `FastAPI` in `Python`.

3. **User Interface Development**
    - A user-friendly application interface was created using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`.

4. **Containerization**
    - The final application was containerized using `Docker`.
